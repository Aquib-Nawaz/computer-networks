Run these commands and we get the output
1) chmod 755 script.sh
2) ./script.sh #portno
Feel free to use any port number. 
If you want to run the code again then chose a different port number
After the script succesfully runs the values are exported to resx.csv and then can be plotted using desmos.
If any thing like "write: Connection reset by peer" or "connect: Connection refused" appears on the screen 
it is to ensure that the connection between previous sender and reciever is succesfully closed before recording the next data.
the output coming on the scren maynot be aligned but the final output in the file resx.csv is perfectly aligned.
plots are provided in the plots folder.
